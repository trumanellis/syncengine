The Direction arrow is confusing. Replace with the name of the original author of the packet with a right arrow to the name of the peer who passed this to me (could be the same or could be a mutual peer)
So should see:
Love → Joy → Peace
where Love is the original author, Peace is the destination but in this example, Peace was offline when Love sent so the packet passed through mutual peer Joy

So the Legend will be:
   Author   Display name of original packet sender
   → Relay    Display name of mutual peer (can be blank)
   → Dest   Display name of intended recipient
   "..."    First ~20 chars of message content (if decrypted) otherwise say encrypted
   ✓        Decrypted successfully
   ○        Global packet (not encrypted)
   ✗        Cannot decrypt (encrypted for someone else)
   S̶t̶r̶i̶k̶e̶    Packet has reached its final desti
